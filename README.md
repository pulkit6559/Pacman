# Pacman
The controlls are fairly simple.
Use W A S D to move and eat all you can.

Happy Gaming!

Future Developments:

Add levels to the game

Use muiltithreading to distribute complex tasks homegenously, as currently the game runs on a single Thread which may cause Flicker on slower CPU's.


SOP

This game was made primary using standard C graphics library ie. <graphics.h>

To play this game use standard controlls W A S D to move the PACMAN inside the environment.
X causes the game to stop.
Every time the game is initiated, a set of 20XN treats gets normally distributed in the environment (Here N decides the difficulty and can be modified on each level)

The pacman has to eat all the treats within the time period or he loses the game.
The score board on the side panel simultaneously displays the percentage of Treats eaten by the Pacman.

This game aims to be a stress reliever and act as a recreational activity for kids which can be run inside a DOS Environment.
